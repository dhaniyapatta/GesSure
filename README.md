# GesSure App

a robust, face-verification-enabled gesture recognition system that utilizes a graphical user interface 
and primarily focuses on security through user recognition and authorization. 
The face model uses MTCNN and FaceNet to verify the user, 
and our LSTM-CNN architecture for gesture recognition, achieving an accuracy of 96% with 5 classes of gestures. 
The prototype developed has successfully executed context-dependent tasks like save, print, control video-player operations and exit, 
and context-free operating system tasks like sleep, shutdown, and unlock intuitively.
